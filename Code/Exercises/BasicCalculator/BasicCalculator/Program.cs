            //Once you have the person choose an operator, then have the user input the two values that will be worked on.

            //Ex:
            //What would you like to do?
            //a) add
            //b) subtract
            //c) multiply
            //d) divide

            //a

            //Enter value #1
            //12
            //Enter value #2
            //10

            //Result = 22
