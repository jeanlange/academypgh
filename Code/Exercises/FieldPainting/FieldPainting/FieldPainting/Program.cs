            // have different sized circles, however. Make
            // a program that will ask for the size of the
            // circle and then tell them how much paint they
            // need to cover the center circle. The paint
            // they use covers about 100 sq ft per bucket.
            // Make sure they have enough paint, it's ok
            // if there is some extra left in the last
            // bucket

            // Show the output like this:
            // It will take 8 buckets to paint the 15' circle
            
            // Bonus: Different colors cover better than
            // others. Let the user pick the color and show
            // the result. The colors are as follows:
            // Red = 100 sq ft/bucket
            // Blue = 120 sq ft/bucket
            // Green = 90 sq ft/bucket
            // Yellow = 70 sq ft/bucket

            // Extra Bonus: The colors also cost different
            // amounts. Tell the user how much it will cost
            // to paint their field.
            // Red = 25$ / bucket
            // Blue = 28$ / bucket
            // Green = 33$ / bucket
            // Yellow = 22$ / bucket
        }
    }
