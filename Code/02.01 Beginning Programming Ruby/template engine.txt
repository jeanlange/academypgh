Template Engine

Write a program that will allow you to make and use templates
for text. An example template would be something like this


The title is ${title} and the body of the text is: ${body}

Written by: ${author}
Date: ${date}


In this example, the template engine should allow title, body, author and date to be replaced
with real data.

The template engine should allow any variables to be added for replacement.
You do not have to use ${} as your template identifier, you can use whatever
you like. {{}} is a good one as well.

Here is a possible interface for this

Template.add_template "Here is a template with ${firstName}"
Template.add_variable "firstName", "John"
Template.get_final #returns "Here is a template with John"
