Night Writer

Convert user text into braille using the traditional 2x3 square of
dots and spaces for each letter (using a 0 for a dot and . for a space).

Each line of text you change will end up with 3 lines of text.

Here is the map of how to braille: http://braillebug.afb.org/braille_print.asp

Eventually we will do this with all of these bits, for now you don't
have to make tests or anything yet, just make it function

Example:

Type something for me to convert:
hello
Your braille version is: 
0.0.0.0.0.
00.00.0..0
....0.0.0.
